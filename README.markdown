### Snack Class

```ruby
class Snack
  attr_reader :name, :quantity
  def initialize(data)
    @name = data[:name]
    @quantity = data[:quantity]
  end
end
```
-   The above Snack class has two attributes: name and quantity.
-   Today you will be building out a Snack class and a VendingMachine class.
-   I have built out tests for the Snack and VendingMachine class.
-   Your mission is to build out the VendingMachine class on your own.
-   I have skipped most of the tests so make sure you are unskipping as you go.
-   Please commit to github every 15 minutes.
