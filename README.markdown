### Snack Class

```ruby
class Snack
  attr_reader :name, :quantity
  def initialize(name, quantity)
    @name = name
    @quantity = quantity
  end
end
```
-   The above Snack class has two attributes: name and quantity.
-   Today you will be building out a VendingMachine class.
-   The name and how many of that snack are what is being added to the vending machine.
-   I have built out tests for the VendingMachine class.
-   Your mission is to build out the VendingMachine class on your own.
-   I have skipped most of the tests so make sure you are unskipping as you go.
-   Please commit to github every 15 minutes.
